permalink: /publication/2023-10-10-VTC2023-Fall60731.2023.10333638
excerpt: 'The paper proposes the driver-TRN model to detect and predict driver behaviors based on real-time vehicular data, such as in-car video, road camera, and sensor data, which addresses intended risks resulting from the interaction between drivers and automated systems that may be overlooked.'
